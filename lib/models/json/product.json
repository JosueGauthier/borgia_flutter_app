            "description": "This five red bases, two are dedicated to salami (fennel and regular), and there's a classic capricciosa or beef carpaccio. Blanco options include a mushroom, and a four-cheese extravaganza featuring great lobes of a tangy fior di latte they make in house every day (more on this later). Classic, precise, good.I think it's still better to think of this venue not as a pizzeria, but as Pizza, by Di Stasio.Rinaldo Di Stasio and Mallory Wall's empire, including the original restaurant and bar in St Kilda, Citta and now Carlton, is a designer label for dining.",

The waiters  signature white tunics are of loosely rumpled linen here versus the crisp whites of the city.

The art, typically, lands a gut punch.From the Bill Henson portraits at the St Kilda restaurant to Shaun Gladwell s beautiful video artworks at Citta, Di Stasio doesn t use pieces to decorate but to provoke. On entry, a bronze cast of Di Stasio s hands jutt out of the wall, immortalised in the sign of the bull – equal parts a rock star welcome and a warning.
